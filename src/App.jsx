    below200: { level: "warning", title: "MSFT is below its 200-day MA", body: "Rare for Microsoft to be below the 200MA. If this happens, it likely means broad market stress or a specific Azure/Copilot growth scare.

In broad market pullbacks, VTI historically recovers — this is exactly when your consistent DCA strategy pays off most.", action: "🟡 Keep DCA-ing. Broad market dips are when you accumulate the most shares per dollar." },
    below200: { level: "warning", title: "VTI is below its 200-day MA — potential bear market signal", body: "This is a rare and serious signal for a total market ETF. VTI below its 200MA has historically preceded extended drawdowns. This doesn't mean sell — it means reassess your risk tolerance and make sure you're not over-leveraged or overexposed to high-beta names like NVDA and AVGO.", action: "🔴 Don't panic sell. But review your individual stock positions for thesis changes. Increase cash DCA frequency." },
    rsiOversold: { level: "opportunity", title: "The entire U.S. market is oversold", body: "When VTI hits RSI below 30, it means broad capitulation.

Not a sell signal, but a signal to be patient with new capital deployment. Let the market breathe.", action: "🟡 Continue DCA but don't lump sum add at these levels." },
  },
  VXUS: {
    below50:  { level: "caution", title: "VXUS is below its 50-day MA", body: "International markets are showing short-term weakness. Given VXUS is already outperforming U.S. equities in 2026, a pullback to the 50MA is healthy consolidation.", action: "🟡 Hold. International outperformance thesis is intact — this is normal consolidation." },
    below200: { level: "warning", title: "VXUS is below its 200-day MA", body: "International markets in long-term downtrend. Check if USD has strengthened significantly (dollar strength hurts VXUS) or if a specific geopolitical event is driving weakness. Your diversification thesis depends on VXUS acting as a hedge — if it's breaking down with U.S. markets, the hedge is less effective.", action: "🔴 Review the diversification thesis. If USD strength is the driver, this may persist. Consider reducing position." },
    rsiOversold: { level: "opportunity", title: "International markets are oversold", body: "VXUS oversold while your thesis says international is outperforming in 2026 is a disconnect — likely a short-term shock. Your 2.8% dividend yield provides a cushion while waiting for recovery.", action: "🟢 Add opportunity. High yield + oversold + outperformance thesis = strong case for adding." },

  MCK: {
    below50:  { level: "caution", title: "MCK slipped below its 50-day MA", body: "After a 55% run over the past year, MCK pulling back to the 50MA is completely normal and healthy. The pharma distribution business hasn't changed — aging population and drug volume trends are multi-decade.", action: "🟡 Hold. A 50MA test after a 55% run is textbook healthy consolidation." },
    below200: { level: "warning", title: "MCK is below its 200-day MA", body: "Unusual given MCK's strong performance. Check for drug pricing regulation news, Amazon pharmacy competitive threats, or broader healthcare sector rotation. With 80%+ ROE and $4B+ FCF, fundamentals remain strong unless regulation is the driver.", action: "🔴 Investigate catalyst. Drug pricing legislation would be a genuine thesis change. Amazon threat is long-term but worth monitoring." },
    rsiOversold: { level: "opportunity", title: "MCK is oversold (RSI < 30)", body: "A healthcare compounder with 80%+ ROE hitting oversold is typically a strong buying opportunity. Institutional buyers tend to step in on quality healthcare names at these levels.", action: "🟢 Add signal. MCK oversold has historically been a profitable entry for patient investors." },
    rsiOverbought: { level: "caution", title: "MCK is overbought after a strong run (RSI > 70)", body: "After gaining 55% in a year, overbought readings for MCK just mean it's extended.
